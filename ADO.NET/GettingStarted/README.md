## Overview

The sample application is meant to get you get started using the ADO.NET driver for Vertica. It connects using a connection string, executes a query, and prints the results.

# Prerequisites

For information on installing .NET, starting a vertica-ce docker container, and how to reference a NuGet package, see the [README.md](https://github.com/vertica/client-application-examples/blob/main/ADO.NET/README.md) in the ADO.NET root directory.

# Configuring the sample application

The app.config contains the default connection string and a query. Just change them to your desired values, run the app, and you should see the results of the executed query.
